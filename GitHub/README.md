## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to help developers collaborate on code. It allows users to host and review code, manage projects, and track changes in a collaborative environment. Key features include repositories (to store code), branches (for feature development), pull requests (to propose changes), and issues (to track bugs and tasks). GitHub is widely used for open-source projects and is integral to many software development workflows.

## History of GitHub
The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed as of 2007 and is located in San Francisco.On February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once, and 4,600 had been merged.That same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub,[26] and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.[28] A year later, this number doubled.[29] ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.[30] On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[31] By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great, reaching 10 million repositories.In 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan, its first outside of the U.S.On February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the third-largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.On June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools
